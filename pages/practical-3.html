    <h2>About Course</h2>
    <p>Front-end web development is eveything involved in programming the user interface of a web application. Typically
        it refers to the Hypertext Markup Language (HTML), Cascaing Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript portion of web
        site production as opposed to the database or server-side programming. It encompasses everything from bilding a
        simple page of HTML text to creating complex, responsive HTML5 websites designed to be accessed via various
        different browsers, devices and screen sizes.</p>
