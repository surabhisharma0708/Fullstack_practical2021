I see a lot of people using it. So I tried to research it, and I found the official Bootstrap site, but there was only a download section and a few words after that. Nothing that explains what is it for... I just understood that it is a front-end helper. I have tried to find something by Googling, but found nothing specific. Everything I found is related to the computer science definition.</p>
